        "\n",
        "Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) Scheduling is a sophisticated scheduling algorithm that allows processes to move between multiple queues based on their behavior and CPU burst characteristics. This adaptability makes it suitable for a wide range of workloads and ensures better overall system performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiple Queues**: The ready queue is divided into several queues, each with its own scheduling algorithm and priority level.\n",
        "- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Processes can move between queues based on their execution history and behavior.\n",
        "- **Aging**: Prevents starvation by gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the lower-priority queues for a long time.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Pros\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Adapts to the behavior of processes, improving responsiveness for short tasks and ensuring long tasks eventually complete.\n",
        "- **Fairness**: Uses aging to prevent starvation, ensuring all processes get CPU time.\n",
        "- **Optimized Performance**: Can be fine-tuned to balance between interactive and batch processing needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Cons\n",
        "- **Complex Implementation**: Requires careful tuning of parameters like time quantum and aging intervals.\n",
        "- **Overhead**: Frequent context switching and queue management can introduce overhead.\n",
        "- **Difficult to Analyze**: Analyzing the behavior and performance can be complex due to the dynamic nature of the algorithm.\n",
