        "   - **Description:** Ensure that resources are either sharable or, if not, limit the number of non-shareable resources.\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Design systems to allow shared access to resources wherever possible.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Use read-only locks where multiple processes can read data simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Hold and Wait:**\n",
        "   - **Description:** Prevent processes from holding resources while waiting for others.\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Require processes to request all required resources at once or release all resources before requesting new ones.\n",
        "   - **Example:** A process must request both a printer and a disk at the same time instead of holding one and waiting for the other.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **No Preemption:**\n",
        "   - **Description:** If a process holding certain resources is denied a further request, it must release its held resources.\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Introduce mechanisms to preempt resources from processes and allocate them to others.\n",
        "   - **Example:** If a process is waiting for a printer but holds a disk, the disk is preempted and allocated to another waiting process.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Circular Wait:**\n",
        "   - **Description:** Prevent the circular chain of resource requests.\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Impose a total ordering of all resource types and require that each process requests resources in an increasing order of enumeration.\n",
        "   - **Example:** Define an order such as {R1, R2, R3}, and ensure processes request R1 before R2 and R2 before R3.\n",

        "\n",
        "The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that dynamically examines the resource allocation state to ensure that a system will not enter a deadlock state. It is named after the way banks handle loan requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Processes (P1, P2, ...):** Entities that request resources.\n",
        "2. **Resources (R1, R2, ...):** Types of resources required by processes.\n",
        "3. **Max:** Maximum demand matrix, where Max[i][j] is the maximum number of resource j that process i may request.\n",
        "4. **Allocation:** Current allocation matrix, where Allocation[i][j] is the number of resource j currently allocated to process i.\n",
        "5. **Need:** Remaining need matrix, calculated as Need[i][j] = Max[i][j] - Allocation[i][j].\n",
        "6. **Available:** Vector representing the number of available instances of each resource.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Steps in Banker's Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:**\n",

        "   - Determine the Available vector.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Request Handling:**\n",
        "   - When a process requests resources, check if the request can be granted without leading the system to an unsafe state.\n",
        "   - Grant the request if the system remains in a safe state; otherwise, deny the request.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Safety Check:**\n",
        "   - Ensure that there exists a sequence of processes such that each process can obtain its maximum resource request with the available resources plus the resources held by all previous processes in the sequence.\n",

        "### Explanation\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization:**\n",
        "   - The `BankersAlgorithm` class is initialized with the number of processes, resources, the available resources vector, the maximum demand matrix, and the current allocation matrix.\n",
        "   - The need matrix is calculated as the difference between the maximum demand and the current allocation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Safety Check:**\n",
        "   - The `is_safe` method checks if the system is in a safe state by trying to find a sequence of processes that can finish with the available resources.\n",
        "   - If a safe sequence is found, the system is in a safe state.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Resource Request:**\n",
        "   - The `request_resources` method handles resource requests from processes.\n",
        "   - It first checks if the request can be satisfied by comparing it to the need and available vectors.\n",
        "   - If the request can be satisfied, it pretends to allocate the resources and checks if the system remains in a safe state.\n",
        "   - If the system is safe, the request is granted; otherwise, the allocation is rolled back.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This code provides a practical implementation of the Banker's Algorithm to handle resource allocation requests and check for system safety. By using this algorithm, systems can avoid deadlocks and ensure that resource allocation is managed safely.\n",
